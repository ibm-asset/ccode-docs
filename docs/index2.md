Cognitive Cloud Open Development (ccode) is a framework to collaborate on the lifecycle of assets, events, publications and projects. It's primary objective is to create a platform for academia and research to collaborate on Open Source projects and publish the results in an iterative manner. Processes are defined to be agile and flexible and to be able to integrate with a standard set of tools that may change over time </p>

Examples of transient events are supernovas, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves. CTN aims to capture events for sources like these, selecting the right set of telescopes and instructing them to take photographs of the events.</p>
 
<p>
Both IBM and some USA universities are collaborating on this initiative. It will involve the integration of software controls for the telescope hardware (pointing, camera control, target selection, etc.) and commissions of the telescope for remote use. The system is designed to be as environmentally friendly as possible with a  net-zero energy environment. The total amount of energy used for the system and its associated infrastructure is no greater than the on-site renewable energy.</p>
