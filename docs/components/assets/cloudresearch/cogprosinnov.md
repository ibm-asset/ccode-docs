**Problem IBM Trying To Solve**<br>
Prosthetics and robotic solutions work well in controlled lab environment but not in the real world (weather, terrain, geospatial location, visual recognition, etc). 
<br>IBM has the technology to add AI and adaptive learning for a prosthetic device to function outside the lab environment
<br><br>
**Components Used are:**
<br>***Watson Services / APIs:*** 
<br> Tone Analyzer, Speech to Text, Text to Speech, Conversation, Visual Recognition
<br>***On-prem:*** 
<br>MQ, DB2, Sensors, Prosthetics, Mobile, Car, Watch
