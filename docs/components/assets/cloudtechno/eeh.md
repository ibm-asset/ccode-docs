The Enterprise Exception Handling pattern provides a standardized method of reporting exceptions in the organization through the ESB that may be analyzed in the future. Most application and system exceptions are reported in a inconsistent manner and often reported in logs that are distributed across every node in the subsystem. The pattern addresses this concern by standardization and centralization of system-wide exceptions in a heterogeneous environment.

The pattern looks into the following concepts for the realization of the process:
<br> - Standardization of the Exception format
<br> - Exception reporting through the ESB
<br> - Integration with the Monitoring System
<br> - Centralization and Statistical Analysis of Exceptions
<br> - Testing Exceptions Conditions
